# Auto-SQL-injection ðŸ’‰
Automated Python program capable of automating time-based and boolean-based SQL injection attacks.

- I created a [php configuration file](https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/Auto-SQL-injection/blob/main/users.php) in which I ran my tests

- Download:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/JoseVazquez101/Auto-SQL-injection
cd Auto-SQL-injection
pip install requeriments.txt
~~~

- You can choose the attack mode, between boolean injections or time injections
- Use:

~~~bash
python3 Auto-SQLi.py --type <t or b>
~~~
